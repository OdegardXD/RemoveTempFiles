# RemoveTempFiles
RemoveTempFiles - Made by OdegardXD

RemoveTempFiles is a simple batch script that removes all files inside Temp, %Temp% and prefetch to delete some unnecessary files.   
Most programs leave temporary files in there and some programs dont delete the files they put in there when they are done.   
It uses DEL with /Q and /S to remove all files inside the folders and subfolders.   
It wont remove the subfolders as that would require RMDIR which i dont have much experience with.  
Windows Only.
